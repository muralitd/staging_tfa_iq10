# Hardware Mutex (HWMUTEX) driver for TF-A.
#
# Provides:
#   hwmutex.c   - low-level HW mutex acquire/release (mmio-based)
#   hwm_lock.c  - ticket-lock and LPM-sync lock built on top of hwmutex
#
# Consumers must also set:
#   PLAT_INCLUDES += -Iinclude/drivers/qti/cpucp/<chipset>
# so that <cpucp_hwio.h> (which defines APSS_CPUCP_S_MUTEX_BASE and
# CPU_LPM_SYNC_DATA_BASE) can be found.  This is typically done in the
# chipset-specific platform.mk before including this file.
